# Code Concepts Quiz

# Project Description
This application is a brief test of the users basic knowledge of three different coding languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The game has a running timer that decreases if the user scores incorrectly and ponits are added when the user is correct.

I got stuck on displaying my final score page. It worked at one point. Feedback would be appreciated, I am going to iron that out in office hours.
